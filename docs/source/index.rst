Welcome to om midi Documentation!
=======================================

**om midi**, a YTPMV/Otomad assistant script for **After Effects**. It is a script that automatically converts MIDI files to keyframes in After Effects. Hope that with the help of om midi, people can be rescued from tedious aligning video and audio, and put more energy into more creative works.

Check out the :doc:`usage <usage>` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the extension.
